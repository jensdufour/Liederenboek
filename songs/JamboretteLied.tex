\beginsong{Jamborette-lied (1994)}
\beginchorus
Jamborette is een feest voor iedereen
Pour vous tous per noi tutti
We are all so happy at the Jamborette
Belgian Scouts enjoy you being here today.
\endchorus
\beginverse
Ninove, our town, is happy you are here
The Scouts are gathering; they came from far and near,
From all over the world together here this week.
We hope you'll be our friend, so don't play hide and seek.
\endverse
\beginverse
Scouting is a bound and we have just one goal:
Having a good time, it sure beats digging coal.
While playing you become a real man of the world
And Nature is the home of every boy and girl.

Pour vous tous per noi tutti

Belgian Scouts enjoy you being here today
Belgian Scouts enjoy you being here today.
