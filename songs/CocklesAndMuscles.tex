\beginsong{Cockles and Mussels}
\beginverse
In Dublin's fair city, Where the girls are so pretty,
I first set my eyes on sweet Molly Malone,
As she wheeled her wheel-barrow,
Through streets broad and narrow,
\endverse
\beginchorus
Crying, "Cockles and mussels, alive, alive, oh!"
"Alive, alive, oh, Alive, alive, oh,"
Crying,  "Cockles and mussels, alive, alive, oh".
\endchorus
\beginverse
She was a fishmonger, But sure 'twas no wonder,
For so were her father and mother before,
And they wheeled their barrows,
Through the streets broad and narrow,
\endverse
\beginverse
She died of a fever, And no one could save her,
And that was the end of sweet Molly Malone.
But her ghost wheels her barrow,
Through streets broad and narrow,
\endverse
