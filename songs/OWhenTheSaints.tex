\beginsong{O when the saints}
\beginverse*
O when the saints, o when the saints,
go marchin in, go marchin in,
O when the saints go marching in.
I want to be in that number.
O when the saints go marching in.
\endverse
\beginchorus
I’ve got in love a father,
he’s gone to heaven I know.
But I would meet him,
when the saints go marching in.
