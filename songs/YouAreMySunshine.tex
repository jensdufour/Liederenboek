\beginsong{You are my sunshine}
\beginverse*
You are my sunshine
My only sunshine
You make me happy, when skies are gray
You’ll never know dear, how much I love you
Please don’t take my sunshine away.
\endverse
\beginverse*
The other night dear,
When I was sleeping
I dreamed I held you in my arms
But when I waked up, I was mistaken
So I laid down my head and I cried.
