\beginsong{Let it be}
\beginverse
When I find myself in times of trouble
Mother Mary comes to me,
Speaking words of wisdom: let it be. 
And in my hour of darknes,
She is standing right in front of me,
Speaking words of wisdom: let it be. 
\endverse
\beginchorus
1:
Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
Whisper words of wisdom: let it be.

2:
Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
Yeh, there will be an answer: let it be
\endchorus
\beginverse*
And when the broken-hearted people
Living in the world  agree,
There will be an answer: let it be.
For thoâ€™they may be parted,
There is still a chance that they will see,
There will be an answer, let it be. 
\endverse
\beginverse*
And when the night is cloudy,
There is still a light that shines on me
Shine until tomorrow, let it be. 
I wake up to the sound of music, 
Mother Mary comes to me,
Speaking words of wisdom: let it be. 
\endverse
