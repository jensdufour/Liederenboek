\beginsong{Blowing in the wind}
\beginverse
How many roads must a man walk down
Before they call him a man?
How many seas must a white dove sail
Before she sleeps in the sand?
How many times must the cannonballs fly
Before they're for ever band?
\endverse
\beginchorus
The answer my friend,
Is blowin' in the wind,
The answer is blowin' in the wind.
\endchorus
\beginverse
How many times must a man look up
Before he can see the sky?
How many ears must one have
Before he can heare people cry?
How many deaths will it take till he know
That to many people had died?
\endverse
\beginverse
How many years can a mountain exist
Before he washed to the sea?
How many years can some people exist
Before they're allowed to be free?
How many times can a man turn his head
And pretend that he just doesn't see?
\endverse
