\beginsong{Home on the range}
\beginverse
Oh give me a home,
where the buffalo roam,
where the deer and the antilope play.
Where the seldom is heard,
a discouraging word,
and the skies are not cloudy all day.
\endverse
\beginchorus
Home, home on the range,
where the deer and the antilope play.
Where seldom is heard
a discouraging word,
and the skies are not cloudy all day.
\endchorus
\beginverse
Oh, give me a land,
Where the bright diamond sand, 
Flows leisurely down the stream.
Where the graceful, white swan,
goes gliding along,
like a maid in a heavenly dream.
\endverse
\beginverse
Where the air is so pure,
the zephyrs so free,
the breezes so balmy and light.
That I would not exchange,
my home on the range,
for all of the cities so bright.
\endverse
