Nobody knows, the trouble I’ve seen,
nobody knows, but Jesus,
nobody knows, the trouble I’ve seen,
glory, hallelujah

Sometimes I’m up, sometimes I’m down,
oh yes, lord.
Sometimes I’m almost to the ground,
oh yes, Lord.

\beginverse*
Oh everyday to you I pray,
oh yes, Lord.
For you to drive my sins away, 
oh yes, Lord.
If you get there before I do,
oh yes, Lord
Tell all my friends I’m coming too,
oh yes, Lord.
