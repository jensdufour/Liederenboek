Hang down your head, Tom Dooley,
hang down your head and cry.
Hang down your head, Tom Dooley,
poor boy, you’re born to die.

\beginverse*
I met her in the mountain,
and there I took her life.
I met her on the mountain,
and stabbed her with my knife.
\endverse
\beginverse*
This time tomorrow,
reckon where I’ll be.
If it hadn’t been for Grayson,
i’d been for Tennessee.
\endverse
\beginverse*
This time tomorrow,
reckon where I’ll be.
In some lonesome valley,
hanging on with oak tree.
