\beginsong{Loch Lomon}
\beginverse*
By you bonnie banks and by yon bonnie braes,
Where the sun shines bright on Loch Lomon’
Where we and my true love were ever wont to be
On the bonnie, bonnie banks of Loch Lomon’
\endverse
\beginchorus
Oh you’ll take the high road, and I’ll take the low road,
And I’ll be in Scotland before you,
But me and my true love will never meet again,
On the bonnie, bonnie banks of Loch Lomon’.
\endchorus
\beginverse*
I mind where we parted in yon shady glen,
On the steep, steep side of Ben Lomon’
Where in deep purple hue, the Highlands hills we view
And the moon coming out in the gloaming. 
The wee birdies sing and the wild flowers spring
And in sunshine the waters are sleeping;
But the broken heart will ken no second spring again,
And the world does not know how we are greating. 
\endverse
\beginverse*
En ik em er goed af, mo gau zetj er slecht van
En gau gotj go sloapen, nog veer mau
Want ik em ervoaring en gau, gau zetj just niks
On the bonnie bonnie banks of the bartentj.
\endverse
